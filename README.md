### Health Systems Strengthening - Key Populations

## Goals
To fulfill ICPIâ€™s objectives, the HSS Cluster has established the following goals, which are integrated into their workplan:
* Harness external datasets to conduct more in-depth analyses of global health systems
* To enhance our understanding of whether PEPFAR is investing in the right HSS activities
* If possible, explore potential relationships between HSS investments and programmatic results

## Routine Program-Area Tools
* Key Populations Dashboard (Excel version)
* Key Populations Dashboard (Analytic workspaces Beta)
* Human resources for health standard analytic datasets (COP18)

## Other Ad-hoc or special analyses
* Various Human resources for health (HRH) analyses that examine relationships between PEPFAR investments in HRH and program results, especially using supplemental data from site-level HRH inventory surveys or human resources inventory databases (Malawi, South Africa, Cote d'Ivoire)
