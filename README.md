# Health Systems Strengthening - Key Populations
Last update: 4/13/2021

## Goals
To fulfill ICPI’s objectives, the HSS - KP Cluster has established the following goals, which are integrated into our workplan:
* Harness external datasets to conduct more in-depth analyses of global health systems
* To enhance our understanding of whether PEPFAR is investing in the right HSS activities
* If possible, explore potential relationships between HSS investments and programmatic results
* To standardize health systems analytics and incorporate them into routine business intelligence products, such as PEFPAR Panorama

## Menu of Analytic Services for FY21 and COP21

### Human Resources for Health (HRH)

-	Analysis of recent HRH inventory data to determine PEFPAR’s HRH footprint by cadre, program area, geography, partner/IM etc.
-	Analysis of HRH inventory data and/or Expenditure Reporting (ER) data to determine PEFPAR’s spend on HRH by partner/IM, geography, program area; and changes over time (if required).  
-	Merging and analysis of HRH data from the inventory or from MER together with other program data, at the site, partner/IM, or geographic levels.  
-	Creation of graphs, maps, or visuals that overlay PEFPAR HRH investment with HIV program targets and/or results.
-	All items listed here will also apply to data from the new HRH inventory reporting requirement beginning in Q4 2021 

### Commodities and ARV supply chain

-	Analysis of TLD transition based on MER or country-specific data sources
-	Analysis of ARV optimization (or dispensing) and viral load suppression, by geography
-	Comparison of patients on multi-month dispensing (MMD) vs. associated bottle counts dispensed 
-	Comparison of total ARV dispensed to total patients on treatment (TX_CURR); and estimated expected dispensing

### Laboratory

-	Analysis of country-specific laboratory management information systems data, and/or merging and triangulation with MER results and program performance metrics down to the site level
-	Creation of laboratory network maps showing either specimen transport or patients or sites in relation to laboratories
-	Other maps that depict laboratory characteristics such as distances between reference lab and patient site in relation to turnaround time

### Key populations

-	Create visuals of key populations cascade (results cascade, or targets cascade)
-	Compare HIV program metrics by KP group
-	Comparison of key populations cascade or results vs. cascade in the general population (KP yield vs. gen pop yield; KP linkage vs. gen pop linkage).

## Who can request support?
[Request support now](mailto:ICPI@state.gov)

S/GAC Chairs, PPMs or S/GAC technical advisors, for COP or POART analysis, or as a policy review

Country teams.  Inquiries are encouraged for ongoing technical assistance, or for specific events like portfolio reviews, COP presentations, or POART presentations, or in response to S/GAC questions.  Inquiries ideally originate from PEPFAR coordinating office (PCO).

Communities of practice (COOP) or short-term-task-teams (ST3) that have analytic questions related to any topics or data covered by the cluster.  Potential examples:  
- Lab-related analytic requests from the VL COOP
- Visuals on KP PrEP results for either the KP and/or PrEP COOP
- Data alignment recommendations from the HRH ST3 related to HRH cadres
