# Health Systems Strengthening - Key Populations

## Goals
To fulfill ICPI’s objectives, the HSS Cluster has established the following goals, which are integrated into their workplan:
* Harness external datasets to conduct more in-depth analyses of global health systems
* To enhance our understanding of whether PEPFAR is investing in the right HSS activities
* If possible, explore potential relationships between HSS investments and programmatic results

## Menu of Analytic Services for FY21 and COP21

######Human Resources for Health (HRH)

-	Analysis of recent HRH inventory data to determine PEFPAR’s HRH footprint by cadre, program area, partner etc.
-	Analysis of HRH inventory data and/or Expenditure Reporting (ER) data to determine PEFPAR’s spend on HRH by partner, SNU, program area; and changes over time (if required).  
-	Merging and analysis of HRH data from the inventory or from MER together with other program data, at the site, partner, or PSNU levels.  
-	Creation of graphs, maps, or visuals that overlay PEFPAR HRH investment with HIV program results.  

######Commodities and ARV supply chain

-	Analysis of TLD transition based on MER or country-specific data sources
-	Calculations of months of treatment dispensed
-	Comparisons of reported of multi-month dispensing vs. reported amounts dispensed per patient

######Laboratory

-	Analysis of country-specific laboratory management information systems data, and/or merging and triangulation with MER results and program performance metrics down to the site level
-	Creation of laboratory network maps showing either specimen transport or patients or sites in relation to laboratories
-	Other maps that depict laboratory characteristics such as distances between reference lab and patient site in relation to turnaround time

######Key populations

-	Create visuals of key populations cascade (results cascade, or targets cascade)
-	Compare HIV program metrics by KP group
-	Comparison of key populations cascade or results vs. cascade in the general population (KP yield vs. gen pop yield; KP linkage vs. gen pop linkage).

##Who can request support?

S/GAC Chairs, PPMs or S/GAC technical advisors, for COP or POART analysis, or as a policy review
Country teams.  Inquiries are encouraged for ongoing technical assistance, or for specific events like portfolio reviews, COP presentations, or POART presentations, or in response to S/GAC questions.  Inquiries ideally originate from PEPFAR coordinating office (PCO), or may originate from agency offices with later concurrence from other agencies and PCO.
Communities of practice (COOP) or short-term-task-teams (ST3) that have analytic questions related to any topics or data covered by the cluster.  Examples:  
- Lab-related analytic requests from the VL COOP
- Visuals on KP PrEP results for either the KP and/or PrEP COOP
- Data alignment recommendations from the HRH ST3 related to HRH cadres

Agency-specific analysis (analytic questions that are primarily apply to, or are raised by, a single agency; or analysis of data that is predominantly or wholly reported/owned by a single agency) should be first directed to your agency subject matter experts and strategic information points of contact.
